# ChatRooM <Badge type="tip" text="0.1.0" />

::: info Before
ChatRooM was maintained by Mark before, but now the project has been transfered to Pdnode to continue developing.
:::

::: warning Tips
The opensource version of ChatRooM(maintained by Mark) updates very slowly, so this part of the docs is only suitable for ChatRooM Enterprise.
:::


::: warning Warning
ChatRooM Enterprise is on a very early developing stage, so we won't consider open it for public in a short time.

ChatRooM uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com). [Why Supabase?](/zh/chatroom/whysupabase.md)

This docs is only written for Pdnode developers.
